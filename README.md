## Problem statement
What is the least number of straight lines you need to draw across a *n* x *n* square grid so that every cell in the grid has at least one of the lines passing through its interior ?  

## Conjecture
It is conjectured that the answer is *n* - 1 for every *n* ≥ 3.

## Exploration
This program constitutes a brute force exploration of this conjecture. In particular, it shows that the conjecture holds for all 3 ≤ n ≤ 8.

Program's output is shown below :
